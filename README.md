- 👋 Hi, I’m @pierorivoira
- Currently I'm mainly interested in population genetics. 
- This field was recently revolutionized by the Coalescent Theory, implemented in computer packages
- that make use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in order to find the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest,
- say the effective population size or the migration rate between several sub-populations. 
- I'm now trying to estimate the latter between some greater mouse-eared bat nursery colonies by using P. Beerli's program migrate-n.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bat population genetics research.
